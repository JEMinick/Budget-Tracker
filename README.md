## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating Budget-Tracker was to provide the user a fast and easy way to track a budget and allow access to that information anytime. Having offline functionality that allows the entry of credits and debits is paramount to this applications success (e.g., while running my mobile device in airplane mode).<br><br>
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is providing an app that tracks withdrawals and deposits regardless as to whether I have an active internet connection.<br><br>
By creating this app, I learned the following: Progressive Web App capabilities using a manifest and indexedDB functionality.
